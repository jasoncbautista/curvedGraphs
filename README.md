## Curved Bar Graph

Curved graphs are simple bar graphs in a curve shape.


HipsterGraphs.drawCurves(0.3, 0.8, 0.4);


This will take the largest number and use it as a reference to graph those values relative to the largest graph.

If you would like to instead use true values:


drawCurves(0.3, 0.8, 0.4, true);

## Circles  Graph

Another graph to represent "bucketing" of elements. 

HipsterGraphs.drawCircles([0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.11, 0.09]);

## Circle pattern

A simple percentage graph:

HipsterGraphs.circlePattern(0.75);
